1. Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2.

HTTP 1.1 :
        * It performs its action based on the text.
	* It compresses all data automatically
	* It uses the resource inline to fetch multiple pages from the server
HTTP 2 :
	* It works with binary protocol
	* It uses HPACK to compress the data
	* It uses push frames on the server to collect multiple pages
